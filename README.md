#Todos App Using APIs & Bloc

Todos is a cross-platform todo list app that helps you stay organized and on top of your tasks. 
It is built with Flutter, an open-source framework that enables the creation of high-quality and 
top-performing mobile applications for mobile operating systems (iOS and Android).

Todos uses an API to get data, which means that the data is always up-to-date. 
This ensures that you always have the latest information about your tasks, 
no matter where you are.

Todos also uses Bloc as state management, which helps to optimize the overall performance 
of the system. This means that the app is always responsive and smooth, even when you have 
a lot of tasks.

The app has a clean and modern design that is easy to use. The user interface is intuitive 
and easy to navigate, so you can quickly find the features you need.
